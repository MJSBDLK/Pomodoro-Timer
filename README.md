# Pomodoro Timer

This is a pomodoro timer web app. The goal of the assignment was to teach writing React function components and using React hooks.
We also used Bootstrap for formatting.

The Pomodoro method was created by Gustav Pomodoro, to see how many tomatos he could eat in one hour. He allowed himself three 5-minute breaks.
This is also not true.

The Pomodoro method is a productivity technique where you intersperse periods of exclusive focus on work with short breaks. One pomodoro would be four focus periods with three short breaks.

This timer allows for 15-60 minutes of focus time, and 1-15 minutes of break time. An alarm sounds at the end of each period.
