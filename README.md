# Pomodoro Timer

This is a pomodoro timer web app. The goal of the assignment was to teach writing React function components and using React hooks.
We also used Bootstrap for formatting.

The Pomodoro method was created by Gustav Pomodoro, to see how many tomatos he could eat in one hour. He allowed himself three 5-minute breaks.
This is also completely false.

This timer allows for 15-60 minutes of focus time, and 1-15 minutes of break time. An alarm sounds at the end of each period.
